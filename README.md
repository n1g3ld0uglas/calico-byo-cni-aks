# Calico CNI on Azure AKS
You can now run Calico CNI on Azure AKS: <br/>
https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/getting-started/kubernetes/managed-public-cloud/aks

## Confirm Calico IPAM is installed
The IPAM plugin can be queried on the default Installation resource.

```
kubectl get installation default -o go-template --template {{.spec.cni.ipam.type}}
```

If your cluster is using Calico IPAM, the above command should return a result of ```Calico```.

## Install Calicoctl
We will follow the official docs for installing the ```calicoctl``` utility: <br/>
https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/maintenance/clis/calicoctl/install <br/>
<br/>
Use the following command to download the ```calicoctl``` binary.
```
curl -L https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/releases/download/v3.23.0/calicoctl-linux-amd64 -o calicoctl
```

Set the file to be executable
```
chmod +x ./calicoctl
```

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Scenario 1: Migrate from one IP pool to another

Pods are assigned IP addresses from IP pools that you configure in Calico. <br/>
As the number of pods increase, you may need to increase the number of addresses available for pods to use. <br/>

Or, you may need to move pods from a CIDR that was used by mistake. <br/>
Calico lets you migrate from one IP pool to another one on a running cluster without network disruption <br/>
https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/networking/migrate-pools <br/>

Let’s run calicoctl with the below command to to see the IP pool, default-ipv4-ippool
```
./calicoctl get ippool -o wide
```

The output should look like this:

```
NAME                  CIDR            NAT    IPIPMODE   VXLANMODE   DISABLED   DISABLEBGPEXPORT   SELECTOR   
default-ipv4-ippool   10.244.0.0/16   true   Never      Always      false      false              all()
```

When we run the below command, we see that a pod is created using the default range (10.244.34.130/32).
```
./calicoctl get wep --all-namespaces
```

```
NAMESPACE          WORKLOAD                                   NODE                                NETWORKS           INTERFACE

```

Let’s get started changing this pod to the new IP pool (10.0.0.0/16). <br/>
We add a new ```IPPool``` resource with the CIDR range, 10.0.0.0/16.

```
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: IPPool
metadata:
  name: new-pool
spec:
  cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
  ipipMode: Always
  natOutgoing: true
EOF  
```  

Let’s verify the new IP pool was created correctly. <br/>
It should reference the new CIDR range, ```10.0.0.0/16```.

```
./calicoctl get ippool -o wide
```

```
NAME                  CIDR            NAT    IPIPMODE   VXLANMODE   DISABLED   DISABLEBGPEXPORT   SELECTOR   
default-ipv4-ippool   10.244.0.0/16   true   Never      Always      false      false              all()      
new-pool              10.0.0.0/16     true   Always     Never       false      false              all()
```

Disable the old IP pool - ```default-ipv4-ippool``` <br/>
Firstly, let's list the existing IP pool definition.

```
./calicoctl get ippool -o yaml > pools.yaml
```

```
cat pools.yaml
```

```
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3

    natOutgoing: true
    nodeSelector: all()
    vxlanMode: Never
kind: IPPoolList
metadata:
  resourceVersion: "20996"
```

Disable this IP pool by setting: ```disabled: true``` <br/>
Add this one line after the ```natOutgoing: true``` field.
```
vi pools.yaml
```

Apply the changes. <br/>
Remember, disabling a pool only affects new IP allocations; networking for existing pods is not affected.

```
./calicoctl apply -f pools.yaml
```

Output should look similar to the below example. <br/>
Verify the changes with the same ```./calicoctl get``` command

```
Successfully applied 2 'IPPool' resource(s)
```

```
./calicoctl get ippool -o wide
```

```
NAME                  CIDR            NAT    IPIPMODE   VXLANMODE   DISABLED   DISABLEBGPEXPORT   SELECTOR   
default-ipv4-ippool   10.244.0.0/16   true   Never      Always      true       false              all()

```

Next, we delete all of the existing pods from the old IP pool. <br/>
If you have multiple pods, you would trigger a deletion for all pods in the cluster.

```
kubectl delete pod -n kube-system <example-coredns-pod>
```

Verify that new pods get an address from the new IP pool. <br/>
Create a test namespace and nginx pod to go in that namespace.

```
kubectl create ns ippool-test
```

```
kubectl -n ippool-test create deployment nginx --image nginx
```

Verify that the new pod gets an IP address from the new range. <br/>
Once you have completed this, cleanup the ```ippool-test``` namespace.

```
kubectl -n ippool-test get pods -l app=nginx -o wide
```

```
kubectl delete ns ippool-test
```

Now that you’ve verified that pods are getting IPs from the new range, you can safely delete the old pool. <br/>
We can now proceed to our next configuration test.

```
./calicoctl delete pool default-ipv4-ippool
```

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Scenario 2: Change IP pool block size
https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/networking/change-block-size <br/>
By default, Calico uses an IPAM block size of 64 addresses – /26 for IPv4, and /122 for IPv6. <br/>
However, the block size can be changed depending on the IP pool address family. <br/>
<br/>
IPv4: 20-32, inclusive
IPv6: 116-128, inclusive
You can have only one default IP pool for per protocol in your installation manifest. <br/>
In this example, there is one IP pool for IPv4 (/26), and one IP pool for IPv6 (/122) <br/>

```
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: default
  pec:
   # Configures Calico networking.
   calicoNetwork:
     # Note: The ipPools section cannot be modified post-install.
    ipPools:
    - blockSize: 26
      cidr: 10.48.0.0/21
      encapsulation: VXLAN
      natOutgoing: Enabled
      nodeSelector: all()
    - blockSize: 122
      cidr: 2001::00/64 
      encapsulation: None 
      natOutgoing: Enabled 
      nodeSelector: all()
```

However, the following is ```INVALID``` because it has two IP pools for IPv4.
```
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: default
  spec:
   # Configures Calico networking.
   calicoNetwork:
     # Note: The ipPools section cannot be modified post-install.
    ipPools:
    - blockSize: 26
      cidr: 10.48.0.0/21
      encapsulation: VXLAN
      natOutgoing: Enabled
      nodeSelector: all()
    - blockSize: 31
      cidr: 10.48.8.0/21
      encapsulation: VXLAN
      natOutgoing: Enabled
      nodeSelector: all()
```

#### Expand or shrink IP pool block sizes
By default, the Calico IPAM block size for an IP pool is /26. <br/>
To expand from the default size /26, lower the blockSize (for example, /24). <br/>
To shrink the blockSize from the default /26, raise the number (for example, /28).


#### Best practice: change IP pool block size before installation
We now know the ```blockSize``` field cannot be edited directly after Calico installation. <br/>
It is best to change the IP pool block size before installation to minimize disruptions to pod connectivity.

#### Create a temporary IP pool
We add a new IPPool with the CIDR range, ```10.0.0.0/16```.

```
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: IPPool
metadata:
  name: temporary-pool
spec:
  cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
  ipipMode: Always
  natOutgoing: true
```

Apply the changes.
```
./calicoctl apply -f temporary-pool.yaml
```

Let’s verify the temporary IP pool.
```
./calicoctl get ippool -o wide
```
```
NAME                  CIDR             NAT    IPIPMODE   DISABLED
default-ipv4-ippool   192.168.0.0/16   true   Always     false
temporary-pool        10.0.0.0/16      true   Always     false
```

#### Disable the existing IP pool
Disable allocations in the default pool.
```
./calicoctl patch ippool default-ipv4-ippool -p '{"spec": {"disabled": true}}'
```

Verify the changes.
```
./calicoctl get ippool -o wide
```
```
NAME                  CIDR             NAT    IPIPMODE   DISABLED
default-ipv4-ippool   192.168.0.0/16   true   Always     true
temporary-pool        10.0.0.0/16      true   Always     false
```

## Delete pods from the existing IP pool
In our example, coredns is our test pod scenario <br/> 
For multiple pods you would trigger a deletion for all pods in the cluster.
```
kubectl delete pod -n kube-system coredns-6f4fd4bdf-8q7zp
```

Restart all pods with just one command. <br/>
```WARNING!``` The following command is disruptive and may take several minutes depending on the number of pods deployed.

```
kubectl delete pod -A --all
```

#### Delete the existing IP pool
Now that you’ve verified that pods are getting IPs from the new range, you can safely delete the existing pool.
```
./calicoctl delete ippool default-ipv4-ippool
```

#### Create a new IP pool with the desired block size

In this step, we update the IPPool with the new block size of ```(/28)```.
Once the changes are configured, apply the file ``` kubectl apply -f```.

```
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: IPPool
metadata:
  name: default-ipv4-ippool
spec:
  blockSize: 28
  cidr: 192.0.0.0/16
  ipipMode: Always
  natOutgoing: true
```

```
./calicoctl apply -f pool.yaml
```

#### Disable the temporary IP pool
```
./calicoctl patch ippool temporary-pool -p '{"spec": {"disabled": true}}'
```

####  Delete pods from the temporary IP pool
In our example, coredns is our only pod <br/> 
For multiple pods you would trigger a deletion for all pods in the cluster.
```
kubectl delete pod -n kube-system coredns-6f4fd4bdf-8q7zp
```

```WARNING!``` The following command is disruptive and may take several minutes depending on the number of pods deployed.
```
kubectl delete pod -A --all
```

Validate your pods and block size are correct by running the following commands:
```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide
./calicoctl ipam show --show-blocks
```

####   Delete the temporary IP pool
Clean up the IP pools by deleting the temporary IP pool. <br/>
Your cluster should now be in the original state you left it in.
```
./calicoctl delete pool temporary-pool
```

## Connecting to Calico Cloud

Although not mention in our docs, the install process worked for Calico Cloud <br/>
https://docs.calicocloud.io/get-started/connect/aks <br/>

<img width="1000" alt="Screenshot 2022-05-13 at 17 20 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82048393/168325678-27e884cd-6e53-4e12-984c-c069bb1e6ebc.png">

Check the installation status with the below command:
```
kubectl get installer default --namespace calico-cloud -o jsonpath --template '{.status}'
```

At this point, I recommend using our supported checklist for troubleshooting advice: <br/>
https://docs.calicocloud.io/get-started/connect/checklist

```
{"clusterName":"my-new-cluster","state":"installing"}
```
After state is ```complete```, Calico Cloud is properly installed. <br/>
<br/>

The ```Network Profile``` will always show as ```CNI=None``` - even after installing Calico CNI plugin
```
az aks show --resource-group my-calico-rg --name my-calico-cluster --query 'networkProfile'
```

Check the status of all Calico Cloud components via the below command <br/>
NB: Wait until all components are set to ```AVAILABLE: true```:

```
kubectl get tigerastatus -w
```
